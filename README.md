# Hi, I'm Madhav Ayyagari 👋

## Product Manager | AI/ML Systems | Robotics | Enterprise Tools

I build products at the intersection of AI, robotics, and real-world operations. Currently leading autonomous robotics product development at **Inductive Robotics**, where I developed a computer vision system achieving **95%+ detection accuracy** for autonomous EV charging robots.

Previously shipped **$70M+ gaming products** at JamCity and built **warehouse management systems** for Fortune 500 logistics operations at Dematic.

### 🎯 What I Do

**AI/ML Product Management**
- Computer vision systems (YOLOv8) and edge AI deployment
- ML data pipelines and model training workflows
- MLOps, model versioning, and production monitoring

**Technical Product Leadership**
- 0-to-1 product development from concept to market
- 12-24 month product roadmaps with measurable results
- Bridge engineering teams and business stakeholders
- Requirements documentation and technical specifications

**Enterprise & Internal Tools**
- Operational dashboards and workflow automation
- B2B SaaS products and internal applications
- Developer tools and data infrastructure

### 🛠️ Featured Projects

#### 🧠 [Personal AI Agent — Self-Hosted Claude Assistant](https://github.com/madhavUF/ml-from-scratch)
A fully self-hosted personal AI assistant that runs on your Mac. Connects to your documents, Google Calendar, and Gmail through a proper Claude tool_use agent loop. Accessible via a web dashboard and a Telegram bot — your data never leaves your machine.

Built as a privacy-first alternative to Claude.ai and generic Claude bots: personal documents stay local, OAuth credentials are brokered by a separate credential server (AgentGate), and conversation history persists across restarts via SQLite.

- **Tech:** Python, FastAPI, Claude Sonnet (tool_use), ChromaDB RAG, SQLite, python-telegram-bot, Node.js (AgentGate)
- **Highlights:**
  - Claude agent loop with 7 tools — searches docs, reads/sends email, checks calendar, saves notes
  - Telegram bot with persistent 30-day memory (SQLite-backed sessions)
  - AgentGate credential broker — AI never handles OAuth tokens directly; full audit log
  - macOS menubar app with auto-restart, launchd daemon for login auto-start
  - Drop-in privacy upgrade vs Claude.ai: all data on-device, self-hosted, open source

#### 🤖 [Autonomous Navigation Robot with YOLO Detection](https://github.com/madhavUF/ros2-picarx)
ROS2-based autonomous robot with real-time object detection using YOLOv8 on Raspberry Pi. Demonstrates edge AI optimization and mobile robotics integration.
- **Tech:** Python, ROS2, YOLOv8, Docker
- **Highlights:** 95%+ detection accuracy, <100ms latency, optimized from 120MB to 6MB

#### 🚗 [CarInspectorAI - Computer Vision for Auto Repair](https://github.com/madhavUF/CarInspectorAI)
AI-powered mobile app for real-time car repair guidance using computer vision. React Native app with Claude Vision API integration.
- **Tech:** React Native, TypeScript, Node.js, Claude Vision API
- **Highlights:** Real-time video analysis, hands-free operation, AR-ready architecture

#### 📞 [AI Phone Assistant with Calendar Integration](https://github.com/madhavUF/ai-phone-assistant)
Personal AI assistant that handles phone calls and manages calendar scheduling automatically. Enterprise automation demonstrating workflow integration.
- **Tech:** Python, FastAPI, Google Calendar API, Vapi, Claude
- **Highlights:** Natural voice conversations, intelligent scheduling, automated summaries
